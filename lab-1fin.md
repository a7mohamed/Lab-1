This is the Lab 1 assignment.
This lab had 8 parts, and unfortunately because of the terminal deciding to not work, I was only able to complete the first 3 steps. I will be making up the rest,
however, I will not be providing screenshots for them because I have not reached there.
OK, for part 1, all we were tasked to do was to greet our teammates and let them know somethings about ourselves. Pretty straightforward.
For part 2, we had to go lookup our course specific accounts. Mine was cs15lfa22gw.
For part 3, we had to download vscode and take a screenshot of our home screen. Mine looked like this:
For part 4, we had to remotely connect to a server using our course specific accounts and changing our passwords. Unfortunately I couldn't get that done but for these
next couples steps, I'll act like I'vee done it.
For part 5, we had to run some commands and figure out what they do. For example, the cd command change the directory your in.
For part 6, we had to copy files back and forth between the computers.
For part 7, we had to run commands and copy files to a remote server with ssh and scp.
For the last part, we had to use what weâ€™ve learned to come up with the best way to make a local edit to WhereAmI.java and then copy it to the remote server 
and running it.
